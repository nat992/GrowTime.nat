# 🌿 Overview

Gardening success depends on many variables including:

* Hardiness zones
* Watering schedules
* Weather

Most gardeners rely on scattered information from search engines, forums, and multiple apps. These sources often provide **generic advice** that does not account for a user’s specific region.

GrowTime solves this problem by combining:

* 🌎 **Location-based plant recommendations**
* ⏰ **Automated care reminders**
* 🌧 **Weather-aware watering notifications**

This allows users to choose appropriate plants and maintain them successfully.

### What to do if it did not launch
Below are some problems that have been encountered and what was done to solve them.
1. If it says that gradle needs to sync in the top of the screen, let it sync
2. If the option to run does not appear, it may need to be built. Click the hammer which is the 6th from the bottom in the tool bar on the bottom left corner. Then click the hammer next to it to build. After building, try launching again.

# Building and testing
To run automated tests and build, run the following command:
```
./gradlew connectedAndroidTest
```
If the build fails, it will show which tests failed. While it is running, you can see what some of the tests are doing on the device shown on the right side of the screen.


# Coding tests
The code for the tests is in the folder "app\src\androidTest\java\com\example\growtime"

# 🚀 Usage

1. Launch GrowTime.
2. Enter your **zip code** or enable **location services**.
3. Browse recommended plants suitable for your region.
4. Add plants to your **plant collection**.
5. Receive reminders when plants need watering.

# 📊 Evaluation

The application will be evaluated using two main metrics.

### Plant Recommendation Accuracy

Accuracy will be calculated using:

```
Accuracy (%) =
(Number of correct recommendations ÷ Total recommendations) × 100
```

The system is considered successful if recommendation accuracy exceeds **75%** across tested regions.

### Reminder System Accuracy

The watering notification system will be tested by simulating weather conditions and verifying that reminders adjust correctly when rainfall occurs.
